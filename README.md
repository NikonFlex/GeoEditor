This project is a simple vector graphics editor that can do simple functions. For example, you can move points and create segments on different layers. During development, I have learned a lot of new mechanics of creating a desktop app. I was my first experience of using WPF. Also, I have learned some new design patterns of development and it was my first attempt to calculate time that development will take.
